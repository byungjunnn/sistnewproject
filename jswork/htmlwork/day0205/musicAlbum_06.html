    <p>Smooth like butter, like a criminal undercover <br>
Gon' pop like trouble breaking into your heart like that, ooh <br>
Cool shade, stunner, yeah, I owe it all to my mother, uh <br>
Hot like summer, yeah, I'm making you sweat like that (break it down!)</p>

<p>Ooh, when I look in the mirror <br>
I'll melt your heart into two <br>
I got that superstar glow, so <br>
Ooh (do the boogie, like)</p>

<p>A side step, right-left, to my beat <br>
High like the moon, rock with me, baby <br>
Know that I got that heat <br>
Let me show you 'cause talk is cheap <br>
Side step, right-left, to my beat <br>
Get it, let it roll</p>

<p>Smooth like butter, pull you in like no other <br>
Don't need no Usher to remind me you got it bad <br>
Ain't no other that can sweep you up like a robber <br>
Straight up, I (got ya) <br>
Making you fall like that (break it down)</p>

<p>Ooh, when I look in the mirror <br>
I'll melt your heart into two <br>
I got that superstar glow, so <br>
Ooh (do the boogie, like)</p>
